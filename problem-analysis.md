# Problem Analysis

The task is to design and implement an **AI-powered Question Answering System** that can read user-provided documents, process the text, and provide relevant answers to user queries. The system must combine **text retrieval** and **natural language generation**.

## Problem Statement
Students and professionals often need to search through large documents to find specific answers. Manually searching is time-consuming and inefficient. A tool is required that:
- Automatically reads the given text/document,
- Finds the most relevant sections based on the userâ€™s question,
- Generates a simple, clear answer.

## Objectives
1. Load textual data from user-provided files (e.g., `.txt`).
2. Break the document into meaningful chunks for efficient searching.
3. Use embedding models to represent chunks and queries in vector space.
4. Perform similarity search to retrieve top relevant chunks.
5. Use a language model to generate concise answers using the retrieved context.
6. Provide fallback or error handling if the model cannot find an answer.

## Scope
- Input: Text documents (e.g., `.txt`, `.docx`).
- Output: Direct and concise answers to user queries.
- Target Users: Students, researchers, or anyone who wants quick answers from their notes or documents.
- Exclusions: The system does not guarantee 100% accuracy. It is not designed for real-time multi-document search at large scale.

## Challenges
- Handling long documents (may exceed model token limits).
- Ensuring the embeddings capture context properly.
- Avoiding irrelevant or hallucinated responses.
- Managing external library compatibility issues (e.g., LlamaIndex vs. manual retrieval).
